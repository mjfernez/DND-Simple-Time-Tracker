# DND-Simple-Time-Tracker
A general purpose day-hour-minute time calculator that can track up to 10 timers simultaneously

Instructions:

Just run the exe or binary file in the folder and you should be good to go! Just make sure the
.ui file is in the SAME DIRECTORY as the application. Sorry for the inconvenience, I will fix this
in a future update
